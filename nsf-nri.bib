@incollection{Calinon2007,
	Abstract = {In this chapter, we explore the issue of encoding,
	recognizing, generalizing and reproducing arbitrary
	gestures. We address one major and generic issue, namely
	how to discover the essence of a gesture, i.e. how to
	find a representation of the data that encapsulates only
	the key aspects of the gesture, and discards the
	intrinsic variability across people motions. The model is
	tested and validated in a humanoid robot, using
	kinematics data of human motion. In order for the robot
	to learn new skills by imitation, it must be endowed with
	the ability to generalize over multiple demonstrations.
	To achieve this, the robot must encode multivariate
	time-dependent data in an efficient way. Principal
	Component Analysis and Hidden Markov Models are used to
	reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and to extract
	the primitives of the motion. The model takes inspiration
	in a recent trend of research that aims at defining a
	formal mathematical framework for imitation learning. In
	particular, it stresses the fact that the observed
	elements of a demonstration, and the organization of
	these elements should be stochastically described to have
	a robust robotic application. It bears similarities with
	theoretical models of animal imitation, and offers at the
	same time a probabilistic description of the data, more
	suitable for a real-world application.},
